ScrapLine is a mobile-first factory automation game built in Unity 6 LTS where players create efficient conveyor belt systems to process scrap materials. Design and optimize your factory layout using touch controls to transform aluminum cans into valuable shredded aluminum.

## 🎮 Game Overview

Build the ultimate recycling factory! Place machines, design conveyor routes, and process materials efficiently:

- **🏭 Factory Building**: Create complex production lines with conveyors and processing machines
- **📱 Mobile Optimized**: Touch-friendly controls designed for smartphones and tablets  
- **⚙️ Machine System**: Spawners generate materials, shredders process them, sellers complete the cycle
- **🔄 Conveyor Networks**: Smart directional belt system that moves items smoothly
- **💰 Credits Economy**: Earn money by selling processed materials, spend on new machines
- **💾 Save & Load**: Persistent factory designs with JSON-based save system
- **📈 Upgrades**: Improve machine speed and capacity with earned resources

### Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Start with 200 Credits** - enough for a basic production setup
2. **Place Spawners** on the bottom edge to generate aluminum cans (costs 50 credits)
3. **Build Conveyor Networks** to transport materials through your factory (20 credits each)
4. **Install Shredders** to process cans into valuable shredded aluminum (75 credits)
5. **Position Sellers** on the top edge to earn credits from completed items (50 credits)
6. **Earn Credits**: Aluminum cans = 5 credits, Shredded aluminum = 15 credits
7. **Upgrade Machines** to increase processing speed and efficiency
8. **Expand Factory** with additional machines as your credits grow

### Key Components

#### Machines (`machines.json`)
- **Conveyor** (20 credits): Moves items in specified directions
- **Spawner** (50 credits): Generates items (max 1-3 with upgrades)
- **Shredder** (75 credits): Processes cans → shredded aluminum
- **Seller** (50 credits): Removes items and awards credits

#### Items (`items.json`)
- **Aluminum Can**: Raw material spawned by machines (sells for 5 credits)
- **Shredded Aluminum**: Processed valuable output (sells for 15 credits)

#### Processing (`recipes.json`)
- **Can → Shredded Aluminum**: Primary transformation recipe

## 🚀 Development Setup

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Unity Hub**
   ```bash
   # Download from https://unity.com/download
   # Or via command line (Linux):
   wget https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHub.AppImage
   chmod +x UnityHub.AppImage
   ```

2. **Install Unity 6000.2.3f1 LTS**
   ```bash
   # Via Unity Hub
   ./UnityHub.AppImage --headless install --version 6000.2.3f1 --changeset c7638eb16d91
   ```

### Opening the Project

1. Clone this repository
2. Open Unity Hub
3. Select "Open" and navigate to the ScrapLine folder
4. Unity will automatically resolve dependencies (5-15 minutes first time)
5. Open `Assets/Scenes/MobileGridScene.unity`
6. **Setup Credits UI** (if not already configured):
   - Create UI > Text - TextMeshPro, position at top of screen
   - Attach CreditsUI script to the text GameObject
   - The script will automatically display current credits
7. Press Play to test the game

### Building

#### Development Build (Standalone)
```bash
Unity -batchmode -quit -projectPath ./ScrapLine \
  -buildTarget StandaloneLinux64 \
  -buildPath ./Builds/Linux/ \
  -logFile build.log
```

#### Mobile Build (Android)
```bash
Unity -batchmode -quit -projectPath ./ScrapLine \
  -buildTarget Android \
  -buildPath ./Builds/Android/ \
  -logFile android_build.log
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing Scenarios

1. **Basic Factory Setup**
   - Start with 200 credits
   - Place spawner on bottom edge (50 credits)
   - Create conveyor path upward (20 credits each)
   - Add shredder machine in path (75 credits)
   - Place seller on top edge (50 credits)
   - Verify items flow and process correctly
   - Watch credits increase as items are sold

2. **Touch Controls**
   - Test machine placement with finger/stylus
   - Verify drag gestures work smoothly
   - Check UI responsiveness on different screen sizes

3. **Save/Load System**
   - Build complex factory layout
   - Save game state
   - Restart application
   - Load save and verify everything restored

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run Unity Test Runner
Unity -batchmode -quit -projectPath ./ScrapLine \
  -runTests -testPlatform PlayMode \
  -testResults TestResults.xml
```

## 📱 Mobile Optimization

ScrapLine is optimized for mobile devices with:

- **Touch-First UI**: Large buttons and drag-friendly interfaces
- **Performance Tuning**: Efficient rendering and memory usage
- **Screen Adaptation**: Responsive layout for phones and tablets
- **Battery Optimization**: Reduced CPU/GPU usage for longer play sessions
- **Gesture Support**: Intuitive pinch, drag, and tap controls

## 🔧 Configuration

### Game Balance

Modify JSON files in `Assets/Resources/` to adjust:

- **Machine Costs**: Upgrade prices in `machines.json`
- **Processing Times**: Speed values for each machine type
- **Item Values**: Economic balance in items and recipes
- **Spawn Rates**: How frequently new materials appear

### Graphics Settings

- **Render Pipeline**: Universal Render Pipeline (URP)
- **Quality Levels**: Configurable graphics presets
- **Resolution Scaling**: Automatic mobile adaptation

## 💰 Credits System

ScrapLine features a complete economic gameplay system:

### Starting Economy
- **New Game**: Begin with 200 credits (exactly enough for basic setup)
- **Minimum Factory**: 1 Spawner (50) + 5 Conveyors (100) + 1 Seller (50) = 200 credits

### Machine Costs
- **Conveyor Belt**: 20 credits
- **Spawner**: 50 credits  
- **Seller**: 50 credits
- **Shredder**: 75 credits

### Item Values
- **Aluminum Can**: 5 credits when sold
- **Shredded Aluminum**: 15 credits when sold (3x more valuable!)

### Strategic Gameplay
1. Build basic production line with starting credits
2. Earn credits by selling aluminum cans (5 each)
3. Invest in shredders for higher-value output (15 vs 5)
4. Expand factory with additional machines
5. Optimize for maximum credits per minute

### UI Setup
The CreditsUI system requires proper Unity setup:
1. Create a TextMeshPro text element in your UI
2. Attach the CreditsUI script to the text GameObject
3. The display updates automatically when credits change
4. Customize display format: "Credits: {0}", "${0}", etc.
